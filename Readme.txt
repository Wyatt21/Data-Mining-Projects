I couldn't get the wikiVote text file to work and I don't know why. 
The code does work with the example from the book. That's what in the training.txt
file. I did modify it a little tho. I noticed in the wikiVote file that it skipped
some numbers like 1 and 2 for example. So I in the training file I added an edge
7,3 to ensure the code would still work despite missing 6.
